The issue likely stems from conflicts or inconsistencies within the project's dependencies or configurations specifically triggered by the `expo prebuild` optimization step.  The solution requires a thorough examination of the `package.json`, looking for any outdated or conflicting packages, especially those involved in native modules or platform-specific code. A detailed analysis of the `eas.json` file if applicable and other configuration files might also reveal any incompatibilities that manifest during the prebuild phase. If the problem persists, it's recommended to create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problematic elements and report it to the Expo community for further assistance.
