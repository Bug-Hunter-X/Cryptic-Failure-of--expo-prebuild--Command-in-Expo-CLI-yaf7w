# Cryptic Failure of `expo prebuild` Command in Expo CLI

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered while using the `expo prebuild` command within the Expo CLI. The command fails without providing informative error messages, hindering debugging efforts.  The project builds successfully without the use of `expo prebuild`, suggesting the issue is isolated to the prebuild process itself.

## Bug Description

The `expo prebuild` command fails silently, providing only a generic error message. Standard troubleshooting techniques (cache clearing, dependency reinstalls, project recreation) have proven ineffective.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Attempt to execute `expo prebuild`.
4. Observe the generic failure message.

## Expected Behavior

The `expo prebuild` command should either complete successfully or provide a detailed error message indicating the cause of failure.

## Actual Behavior

The command fails with a vague error message, offering no clues about the root cause.
