While building an Expo project, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message wasn't very specific, simply stating a failure during the prebuild process without detailing the root cause.  The project builds fine without using `expo prebuild`, suggesting a problem with the prebuild process itself rather than the code. I've tried clearing the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and even creating a fresh project but still get the same cryptic failure.
